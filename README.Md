Usage
=====

When transferring over docs, make sure the directory structure here is `docs/index.html` - i.e. move all the content from the src/ directory in the sphinx build into a docs directory. 

Make sure also to include the `.nojekyll` in the `docs/` directory. Github pages expects to find the root html here.
