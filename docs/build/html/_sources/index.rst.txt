Psychex
=======

Psychex is a psychology and cognitive science library in JavaScript for building online experiments using JavaScript.
It was built by A. Grogan in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford.

The main goal of Psychex is to make it easy to build gameified experiments.

Psychex is completely free and open-source. It's designed to be customised and extended, and 
open-source contributions are entirely welcomed and appreciated.

How to Use These Docs
---------------------

These docs contain most (if not all) of the information necessary for using Psychex. You can 
approach them by either reading through how the classes are built and used, but we suggest 
learning by following through tutorials. In particular, a good learning route might be: 

   #. Read the Getting Started page
   #. Follow the n-arm bandit tutorial
   #. Look through the styles and aesthetics docs, and follow through the examples
   #. Go through the example where we recreate an experiment by Ho, M. (2022)
