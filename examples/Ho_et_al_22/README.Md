# Ho, M. *et al.* (2022)

This example recreates Ho & colleagues' experiment from their 2022 Nature paper titled *People construct simplified mental representations to plan*.

In this work, they use an experimental paradigm where participants see a gridworld populated by obstacles, a start point, and an end point. The participant is tasked with navigating to the end point while avoiding the obstacles. Initially, all obstacles are visible during navigation (this is changed in later experiments). Finally, they are queried about their awareness of a particular obstacle during the trial.

The mazes used are 11x11 each containing 7 blue tetronimo obstacles
