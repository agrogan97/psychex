## Expectations about future learning influence moment-to-moment feelings of suspense

In this example, we're recreating the online game portion of a 2021 study by Li, Bramley, & Gureckis. A primary aim of this study was to explore the extent to which suspense represents the "expected future belief update" (Ely *et al.*, 2015).

The experimental design was chosen to satisfy 2 criteria in particular:
1. Quantifiable in a predictable way
2. Decoupled external stimulus and internal belief, to minimise confounds in the source of suspense

To achieve this, the authors used a modified Blackjack-inspired game. The first experiment in their study aimed to examine the explanatory power of the Ely model by presenting a range of stimuli across the spectrum of proposed suspense levels. The flow of the game is as follows:

1. The player is shown a deck of 9 cards, which are then flipped and shuffled.
2. The top two cards on the deck are revealed.
3. For a subset of players (around 60%), they are asked to rate their current level of suspense on a scale of 1 (no suspense) to 5 (high suspense).
4. The player is asked to press a key on their keyboard that spins a wheel to determine which of the two revealed cards they will draw. 
5. Their cumulative sum is added to a graph on the screen.

The card-shuffling and wheel-spinning were included to increase engagement and make the players believe the outcomes are random, when in fact the sequence is prescribed by the researchers according to the Ely suspense model. In the original experiment, of the 191 total players, roughly half (N=96) were allocated high-suspense stimuli, while the rest received low-suspense stimuli.

The original authors included other conditions (such as early stopping when the player reached 21, versus taking the final value, and the option to play a subsequent round) - however for the purposes of this example, we'll recreate a single version - namely, one where the player draws 5 cards, and wins or loses based on if their final score is greater than 21.
